## PENTAGO Game
PS0001 - Introduction to Computational Thinking (Group Project)

## Project Overview
This project is a Python implementation of the Pentago board game, developed as part of the PS0001 Computational Thinking course. The game supports human vs human and human vs computer gameplay, with multiple difficulty levels for the computer player.
Pentago is played on a 6×6 board divided into four 3×3 quadrants. Players take turns placing a marble and rotating one quadrant, aiming to align five consecutive marbles horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
